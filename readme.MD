# MVC-API Architecture

MVC-API architecture is used for building **RESTful APIs** with clear separation of concerns:

- The **controllers** manage the application logic and handle API requests.
- The **models** define the data structures and interact with the database.
- The **routes** define the API endpoints and their routing logic.
- The **tests** contain unit and integration tests to ensure the correctness of the API.
- The **utils** provide helper functions and utility classes for reusable logic.
